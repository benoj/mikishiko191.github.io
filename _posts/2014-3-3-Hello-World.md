Between 2015 and 2016, Kelly spent 340 days on the International Space Station (ISS) — the longest any American has ever spent in free fall around our planet. The purpose of the mission was to study how long periods in zero gravity affect the human body and mind. After all, if we want to go to Mars one day — a trip that’d last about nine months, at current rates of travel — we’d better know how to get there healthy.

In his autobiography, which comes out October 17th, Kelly talks about his journey from “blue-collar New Jersey” to NASA to the ISS. His childhood — marred by an alcoholic father and what Kelly says today would be diagnosed as ADHD — is the typical tale of “boy of modest means works hard to accomplish his dream, and it pays off.” Except in Kelly’s case, that dream didn’t come until he was 18 and a freshman in college, when he was assigned to read The Right Stuff by Tom Wolfe. The book, about the first pilots who went to space, gave Kelly his calling: to a be a naval aviator. Once he found his “spark,” as he calls it, “I just forced myself to learn how to pay attention and then eventually how to study and be a good student,” Kelly tells The Verge. “It wasn’t easy.”

His description of growing up in West Orange, NJ, is focused on details: riding the family car to the Jersey Shore in the middle of the night wearing pajamas, building rafts out of spare fence planks to ride in the lagoon, and working as an EMT in Jersey City. It’s as if Kelly knew he was going to write a memoir, and took careful notes on his youth. (Kelly says he didn’t keep a journal as a kid, but remembered all those stories because he told them over and over. “In some ways, I’m kind of a natural storyteller,” he says.) But as compelling as his life story is, including dangerously landing an F-14 on an aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea during a sandstorm, the most captivating parts of the book come when Kelly describes the time he spent preparing to launch, or the time he spent in space.

In his telling, astronauts perform some weird rituals before boarding the Soyuz rocket in Kazakhstan, the only rocket currently ferrying people to the ISS. One involves having their entire bodies wiped down with alcohol wipes, to kill germs. Another one is peeing on the right rear tire of the bus transporting space travelers to the launchpad. It’s tradition: Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space, did the same in 1961 before his historic first flight — and he came back alive. So before rocketing to space, Kelly had to do the same. (Women astronauts usually bring a bottle of urine or water to spray the tire.)
